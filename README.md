This is my first project as a Full-Stack Developer. It was built with CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This is the first version of this app.

In the future, I hope to enhance my Academic Multi-Page website with advanced features like authentication, admin functionalities, and personalized student result access using React and Node.js
